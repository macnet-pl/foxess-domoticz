I am working on integration module with Domoticz.

I already have the first data presented in Domoticz. Tests are in progress.
Data sent from the inverter in real time gives great possibilities when it comes to configuration and use of current electricity fotovoltaic production.

No additional system components are needed - the entire integration is based on programming solutions.

The module will be available soon (as soon as possible)...
